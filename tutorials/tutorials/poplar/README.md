# Poplar Tutorials

These tutorials provide hands-on programming exercises to enable you to
familiarise yourself with creating and running programs using Poplar and
PopLibs. They are intended to complement the [Poplar and PopLibs User
Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-user-guide/en/latest/) and the
[Poplar and PopLibs API
Reference](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-api/en/latest/). It is
assumed that you have already downloaded and installed Poplar, and that
you are familiar with C++ and command-line compilation tools.

For most of the tutorials we've included two directories. One, called
`start_here`, contains the bare structure of the tutorial as a starting
point and the other, `complete`, contains the finished code for
reference. Each tutorial also has a `tests` directory, which checks that
the code can be compiled and run. See the README file in each test
directory for more information.

All the tutorials are in C++. They can run on a simulated IPU, so you
should be able to create the code, compile and run them as you work
through this text even if you do not have access to IPU hardware.

Each of the tutorials contains its own README file with full
instructions.
